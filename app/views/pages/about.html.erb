    <h2>What is Class Sap?</h2>
    <p>Class Sap is a classroom management tool for teachers. As a teacher, I found myself giving treats to students and having no way to track this data. Many of my colleagues gave out fake dollars as a prize, but had trouble knowing when a student had received money or might be in debt. Then came the classroom store! We had vouchers, coupons, fliers taped to the wall... and keeping up with all of it was a tremendous pain. So I invented Class Sap, a management tool for all of those things. Students can actually log in and see what you've added to the store - and when they buy an item, it tells you! So much less paperwork to keep up with.</p>
